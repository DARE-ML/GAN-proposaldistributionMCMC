# GAN-proposaldistributionMCMC
GANs for proposal distribution in MCMC


Things to try in order:
1. GAN param sampling.
2. GAN param sampling on larger dataset and problems such as MNIST and LSUN classification.
3. WGAN on param sampling.
4. incorporate GAN into LDMCMC training loop.
5. parallel tempering.
6. welling's stochastic batch without extra forward pass evaluation.
